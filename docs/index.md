# Container Camp Sydney 2017 notes

Hello! I'm [Ryan Blunden](https://au.linkedin.com/in/ryanblunden) and I learn the most at conferences by taking notes. Very rough notes ;).

This repo and micro-site is the entire capture of my notes and musings from the [Container Camp Sydney 2017 conference](https://2017.container.camp/au/).

*Please note* that this content is *my opinionated interpretation and paraphrasing* of workshops and presentations and as such, does not represent the actual content, thoughts or opinions of the presenters. It is full of typos and badly constructed sentances. It is a brain dump, not a series of essays.

If I have written something you disagree with and needs to be corrected, please create and issue or make a pull-request.

Hopefully you find these notes useful!

## Conference schedule

Take a look at the [Container Camp 2017 conference schedule](https://2017.container.camp/au/schedule/) as I did not take notes for all sessions.

The conference oraganisers will also be publishing all [videos on their YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvksXSnLqIVM_uFB7xyrsSg).
